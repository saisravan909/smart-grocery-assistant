# Smart Grocery Chat Assistant using Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This project is a **context-aware chat assistant** that helps users plan meals and generate personalized grocery lists. Built using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, the assistant tailors its responses based on:

- **Who** the user is
- **Where** they are
- **What** their intent is
- **When** they're asking
- **Why** (preferences, diet, budget, history)
